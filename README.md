# Ray-Tracer
A final year coursework for my Advanced Computer Graphics, where we were tasked with understanding the ways of representing, rendering, and displaying pictures of 3D objects 
by mathematically modelling the interaction of light on mesh models through creating a ray tracer.

Currently re-writing the main sections from scratch:
- Colour
- Directional Light
- Framebuffer
- Hit/intersection 
- Light
- Main file
- Phong
- Polymesh
- Ray
- Sphere
- Transform
- Vector
- Vertex

Will be adding:
- Spotlights
- Anti-Aliasing
- Textures
