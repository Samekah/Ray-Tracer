# Ray-Tracer
A final year coursework for my Advanced Computer Graphics module, where we were tasked with understanding the ways of representing, rendering, and displaying pictures of 3D objects by mathematically modelling the interaction of light on mesh models through creating a ray tracer. The test7 image file, shown below, is the end result of my coursework.
